                        I was one of the fortunate ones who was able to complete my education in the same school from pre-kindergarten through<br>the 12th grade. Our school was governed by a fantastic, powerful, and independent principal who encouraged us to grow in<br>our faith in religion and consider the moral principles of life.

                        College was an entirely different experience for me because I had to relocate to a neighboring state to attend classes, and it<br>took some time to adjust to the cultural shock. However, I was fortunate enough to make a lot of friends, participate in a<br>number of sports, and work on a few projects. As a result, a single paragraph cannot properly summarize my college degree.
