                        </div>
                        I only had to discover a basepaper about various ways to detect weapons, conduct a case study on it, write a seminar report, and then<br>present the entire project to my classmates. I didn't have to create this project entirely from scratch.

                        <h3> Pandamic Information Mining:<br></h3>
                    </div>
                    One of the projects I had to start from scratch on was this one. My team and I were able to apply several algorithms to discover<br> information about the situations during the pandemic, such as the number of deaths, cases, etc. in any specific place by using<br>Twitter Api to collect tweets from Twitter.

                            <h3> Diabetic Retinopathy:<br></h3>
                        </div>
                        Diabetic Retinopathy is a condition when the patient starts loosing his/her vison due to diabetes. My team and I created our own<br>Res-W net by combining to Res-U networks thus providing a better accuracy for the disease. We also won the second place out of all<br>the projects in our department.
